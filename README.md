# FLYING SQUARE GAME

## Introductions
A Flappy Bird-esque game with the objective of navigating your `square` through the opening between the top and bottom obstacles to score a point. As long as player's do not touch one of the many spawning objects, they will continue to accrue points. See how far you can go before you get touch one of the obstacles.

## How to play

Players can use either the `Spacebar` on their keyboard or `left-click` with your mouse to make the `square` to fly. Navigate through the opening and try not to touch any of the obstacles to see how high you can score before you do.
