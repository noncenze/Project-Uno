# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to create a basic layout for my video game from some of the resouces I was able to find online. 
2. I hope to implement some of the core functions of the game into the script by the end of the day.
3. No major blockers right now because I haven't gotten to that part, but a blocker I'm expecting is randomizing a function of the game to match the difficulty as the game progresses.  

# Monday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to construct the character into my game along with applying gravity physics to it when no actions are taken.
2. My goal is to create the obstacles in the game and have the basic objective of the game (i.e. flying through the openings) implemented by the end of today.
3. The only blockers I've ran into so far is incorportating a loaded image into the game and having that displayed. However, I've circumvented that for now so I can focus on the core functionality of the game and will come back to the look when I have more time.

# Tuesday

- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to add in the obstacles with functionality into the game. Additionally, I was finally able to implement clicking as an input allowing players to player using either their keyboard (using Spacebar) or their mouse (using clicks) to allow the character to fly.
2. My goal for today is to implement hit detection and establish the win/lose conditions of the game.
3. No major blockers as of this moment, but I still haven't been able to implement images instead of blocks. However, I wasn't really looking into it and focused more on the functionality of the game and will address it if I have enough time.
