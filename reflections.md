1. I was able to create a basic layout for my video game from some of the resouces I was able to find online. 
2. I hope to implement some of the core functions of the game into the script by the end of the day.
3. No major blockers right now because I haven't gotten to that part, but a blocker I'm expecting is randomizing a function of the game to match the difficulty as the game progresses.
