# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to create a basic layout for my video game from some of the resouces I was able to find online. 
2. I hope to implement some of the core functions of the game into the script by the end of the day.
3. No major blockers right now because I haven't gotten to that part, but a blocker I'm expecting is randomizing a function of the game to match the difficulty as the game progresses.  

# Monday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to construct the character into my game along with applying gravity physics to it when no actions are taken.
2. My goal is to create the obstacles in the game and have the basic objective of the game (i.e. flying through the openings) implemented by the end of today.
3. The only blockers I've ran into so far is incorportating a loaded image into the game and having that displayed. However, I've circumvented that for now so I can focus on the core functionality of the game and will come back to the look when I have more time.

# Tuesday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to add in the obstacles with functionality into the game. Additionally, I was finally able to implement clicking as an input allowing players to player using either their keyboard (using Spacebar) or their mouse (using clicks) to allow the character to fly.
2. My goal for today is to implement hit detection and establish the win/lose conditions of the game.
3. No major blockers as of this moment, but I still haven't been able to implement images instead of blocks. However, I wasn't really looking into it and focused more on the functionality of the game and will address it if I have enough time.

# Wednesday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. Yesterday, I was able to implement score keeping, hit detection, and a game over condition.
2. My goal today is to implement high score tracking along with a 'Start'/'Ready' menu so players can intiate the game when they press or click a certain button. Currently, the game just starts immediately when the website is fully loaded so implementing a 'Start' menu will give players time to ready-up.
3. My current blocker is figuring out how to display and retain the highest score achieved along with creating and implementing a 'Start' menu.

# Thursday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to implement the Start/Reset button as well as the graphics for the game.
2. Just fleshing out any bugs/issues and getting it reay for presentation.
3. No major blockers that would hinder my game, just small things I would love to implement. However, that can wait for future updates.

# Friday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I was able to flesh out any bugs and correct a moajority of my issues/bugs. However, there are still some present that I will need to address in the future, but it is playable and presentable.
2. Have a good presentation
3. No blockers as of this moment, just hope I can present my game in an intelligent manner.

# Learning Experience
- [x] What HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
- [x] What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?
1. I predominately built my game in JavaScript with some HTML and CSS elements since I wanted to work more with JavaScript and understand how to better develop/engineer using coding. As a result, I learned a significant amount about functions and arrays that I was having issues with earlier in the course. 
2. Honestly, everything. I feel I am still having trouble with a lot of things, but I'm understanding it little by little with each passing day as I continue to see other ways of doing things. However, if I had to pick one thing, it would be conditional statements and constructing them better. I had a rough time making a conditional statement for my hit detection since I was working with two different obstacles and their location.
